meta-mixins-lts - kirkstone/rust
================================

A "mixin" layer for adding current Rust toolchain into the Yocto Project LTS.
At the time Kirkstone was released in May 2022 it included Rust 1.59.0, and
officially Kirkstone supports only that. This thin special-purpose mixin
layer is meant to provide a current Rust toolchain for Kirkstone by
backporting the appropriate recipes from the master branch of
openembedded-core.

Notes
-----

- **Not all Rust version updates carried here have been individually tested!**
  Care has been taken to keep backported changes in the same order as they
  have been applied to oe-core, so the various older Rust versions should
  be buildable, but that is not guaranteed.  It is highly recommended that
  you perform your own tests for correctness when using this layer.  The
  cargo-ptests bbclass has been backported to potentially assist with
  doing so.
- cargo-update-recipe-crates.bbclass has been backported with a tweak to
  use host rather than native Python since kirkstone does not have a new
  enough Python (3.11 is required).  Using the update task in the class
  will fail unless the host environment contains Python 3.11 or newer.
- The newer version of librsvg from master has been backported since
  there is not a straightforward way to update the existing one via
  bbappend.  Backporting a working recipe should be easier to maintain
  than developing an update of the older recipe in kirkstone.
  Due to librsvg 2.59.x requiring meson 1.2.0, the recipe has been
  updated to the latest release of the 2.58.x branch (2.58.5), and that
  will likely be kept until there are issues building it with newer
  versions of Rust.
- A newer cairo recipe (1.18.0 as of August 2024) has been backported
  to enable building librsvg 2.57.1 and newer.  It is believed this has
  minimal impact on other cairo users.
- python3-cryptography has been left alone since the recipe in kirkstone
  still works with the newer toolchain, and updating it seems to have
  more potential impact due to upstream API changes and its known to be
  finicky build.  This may change if sufficient rationale for doing the
  backport becomes apparent.
- While changes to Rust recipe and class files related to oe-selftest
  support are included by necessity, and the Rust selftest is backported
  (as "rust_mixin") to simplify the backporting workflow, note that no
  effort has been made to ensure the selftest passes, and doing so is
  not considered a priority.
- To include Rust support in a SDK, do the following in e.g. local.conf:
  ```
  TOOLCHAIN_HOST_TASK:append = " packagegroup-rust-cross-canadian-${MACHINE}"  
  TOOLCHAIN_TARGET_TASK:append = " ${@multilib_pkg_extend(d, 'libstd-rs')}"
  ```
  Overriding populate_sdk_base.bbclass to avoid needing to do this seems
  too invasive for this layer.
- The intent is to track any further upgrades that occur in the master
  branch of oe-core, with an expected end of support in April 2026, the
  same as Yocto Project's planned EOL for Kirkstone (per
  https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases).
- At present, no changes related to the addition of UNPACKDIR for the YP
  styhead release have been backported, as it presently looks like trying to
  accommodate them will be more effort than not.  That may change in the
  future.

  layers: meta  
  branch: kirkstone

Contributing
------------

The yocto-patches mailinglist (yocto-patches@lists.yoctoproject.org) is used
for questions, comments and patch review. It is subscriber only, so please
register before posting.

Send pull requests to yocto-patches@lists.yoctoproject.org with

When sending single patches, please use something like:
git send-email -M -1 --to=yocto-patches@lists.yoctoproject.org --subject-prefix='meta-lts-mixins][kirkstone/rust][PATCH'

Note that changes that are not direct backports from oe-core master branch, or
are not fixes for a demonstrated build breakage against Kirkstone are unlikely
to be accepted.  Functional changes should be submitted and merged to oe-core
master branch first.
